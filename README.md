Cameron Chafin, Samantha Jarrah, Claudia Sitiriche, Emily Craven

## Summary
Utilizing the OpenAI API, this application generates a vocabulary worksheet for ESL/English teachers based on user input.

## Application Features
- An index page, which explains the function of the application to the user and provides a button for the form page
- A form page, which allows the user to provide input on the type of worksheet they would like to generate based on:
    - grade level
    - english ability 
    - vocabulary list
    - question type 
       - fill in the blank
       - definition matching
       - multiple choice
       - synonym
       - antonym
- Once the form is submitted, a call is made to the OpenAI API to generate a random worksheet in a visually pleasing format
- The user is routed to a download page where they may preview the generated .pdf and download if they wish

## Technologies Used

## Notes
Challenges we faced:
- Git, always Git
- Flask syntax
- Connecting the frontend and backend
- Inputting the ChatGPT response into a .pdf and allowing the file to download locally to the userâ€™s computer
- Working out deployment bugs 
Lessons Learned:
- Keep track of all required packages in a requirements.txt file 
- Be very specific in prompting ChatGPT
- We gained a more solid understanding of how to use git
- Beginning to understand server and routing functionality
Future Improvements:
- Develop forms for various subjects
- Move from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS to give more control
- Using DALL-E, or other image generation, to incorporate matching vocab words to AI generated images
- Output document in a more readily editable file
